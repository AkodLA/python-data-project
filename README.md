# Python Data Project

This is an ongoing Python project focused on data handling, structure, and basic analysis.
my program takes a csv datafile of a competition score results for 199 competitors, those results are read, filtrated and analysed, the main file showcases the treated data.
The goal of the project is to practice clean code, project structure and real world problem solving.
it can be run from the project directory by writing: python src/main.py

Work in progress.
