# Python Data Project

This is an ongoing Python project focused on data handling, structure, and basic analysis.
my program takes a csv datafile of a competition score results for 199 competitors, those results are read, filtrated and analysed, the main file showcases the treated data.
The goal of the project is to practice clean code, project structure and real world problem solving.
The program handles now several errors and following if they are fatal errors, domain errors or even logical prevention, they get 
treated in a different way, the fatal errors are handled in the main program, the domain errors in the data_grab.py and the logical preventions in the data_treat.py file.
it can be run from the project directory by writing: python src/main.py

Work in progress.
